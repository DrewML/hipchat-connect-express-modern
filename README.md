# HipChat Connect - Modern Addon Starter

This project is a fork of the example HipChat/Express addon provided by Atlassian. The primary differences are:

1. Upgraded to Express 4 (from 3)
2. [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) configured out of the box for ES2015 transpilation

## Requirements

1. Must be using a version of `node.js` >= 5.0.0

## Usage

Still a WIP.
